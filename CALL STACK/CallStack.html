    <!--! CALL STACK  -->
    <!--todo In JavaScript, the call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of functions.  -->
    <!--todo It operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last function called is the first one to finish executing.  -->

    <!--! Call Stack Progression: -->
    <!--? foo() is called, and its execution context is pushed onto the call stack. -->
    <!--? console.log("Inside foo") executes. -->
    <!--? bar() is called, and its execution context is pushed onto the stack. -->
    <!--? console.log("Inside bar") executes. -->
    <!--? bar() completes, its context is popped off the stack. -->
    <!--? foo() completes, its context is popped off the stack. -->
    <script>
        function foo() {
            console.log("Inside foo");
            bar();
        }

        function bar() {
            console.log("Inside bar");
        }

        foo();
    </script>
