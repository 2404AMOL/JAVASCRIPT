    <!--! Difference between Map and Filter  -->
    <!--* The main difference Map and Filter  -->
    <!--* Map and Filter are two built-in JavaScript array methods that perform different operations on arrays. -->
    <!--* Map creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. -->
    <!--* Filter creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. -->
    <!--* Both methods return a new array, leaving the original array unchanged. -->
    
    <!--! Map  -->
    <!--! 1.creates a new array by applying a transformation function to every element in the original array -->
    <!--! 2.The new array will have the same length as the original, but each element will be modified according to the function.  -->
    <!--! 3.Use map when you want to transform every element in an array.  -->
    <!--! 'Map' is used to apply a function on every item in an array and returns the new array -->

    <!--? Filter  -->
    <!--? 1.creates a new array by selecting elements from the original array that satisfy a specific condition. -->
    <!--? 2.The new array may have a different length than the original, containing only the elements that passed the test. -->
    <!--? 3.Use filter when you want to select specific elements from an array. -->
    <!--? 4.'Filter' is used to create a new array from an existing one, containing only those items that satisfy a condition specified in a function -->
    <script>
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // map: double each number
    const doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2);
    console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    // filter: keep only even numbers
    const evens = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
    console.log(evens); // Output: [2, 4]
