    <!--! Reduce  -->
   <!--* The result of the reduce method is one value  -->
   <!--* The length is always One   -->
   <!--* The reduce() method executes the callback function once for each element present in the array. -->
   <!--* The callback function is provided with four arguments: accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, and array. -->
   <!--* The accumulator is the accumulated value, currentValue is the current element value, currentIndex is the index of the current element, and array is the array being traversed. -->
   <!--* The reduce() method does not execute the callback function if the array is empty. -->
   <!--* The reduce() method does not execute the callback function if the array has only one element. -->
   <!--* The reduce() method does not execute the callback function if the array has no initial value provided. -->
   <!--* The reduce() method does not execute the callback function if the array has only one element and an initial value is provided. -->
   <!--* The reduce() method does not execute the callback function if the array has only one element and no initial value is provided.
    <!--? reduce() method is used to perform a computation on an array, such as finding the sum of all elements. -->

    <!--* The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single output value. -->
    <!--* The reduce() method does not change the original array. -->
    <!--* The reduce() method does not have an initialValue argument. If initialValue is provided, it is used as the initial value before processing the array elements. -->
    <!--* If initialValue is not provided, reduce() uses the first element of the array as the initial value. -->
    <!--* The reduce() method does not execute the callback function if no initial value is provided and the array is empty. -->
    <!--* The reduce() method does not execute the callback function if the array has only one element and no initial value is provided. -->
