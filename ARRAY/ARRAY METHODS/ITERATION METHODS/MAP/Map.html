    <!--! Map()   -->
    <!--* Map() method is used to iterate the Array Element along with we can Modify the Array element  -->
    <!--* It returns a new Array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.  -->
    <!--* The map() method does not change the original array.  -->

    <!--* The for loop is only iterate the elements it does not modify the Array Elements  -->
    <!--? map(elements,Index value)  -->
    <!--! The map() method accept only two parameter 1.Elements 2.Index Value  -->
    <!--! Inside the map method we have pass the Arrow Function  -->

    <!--* The map() method does not execute the function for array elements that are undefined or null.  -->
    <!--* The map() method does not execute the function for array elements that are of primitive data types (such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc.).  -->
    <!--* The map() method does not execute the function for array elements that are functions.  -->
    <!--* The map() method does not execute the function for array elements that are objects (including those created using the Object() constructor).  -->
    <!--* The map() method does not execute the function for array elements that are arrays.  -->
    <!--* The map() method does not execute the function for array elements that are sparse (i.e., with non-integer indices). -->
