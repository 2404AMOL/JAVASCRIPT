    <!--! Promise.all()  -->
    <!--* static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single  -->
    <!--* promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises.  -->
    <!--* If any of the input promises rejects, the returned promise rejects with the first  -->
    <!--* rejection reason. -->
    <!--* If all the input promises resolve, the returned promise resolves to an array  -->
    <!--* containing the resolved values of the input promises. -->
    <!--? Notes: -->
    <!--? Promise.all() does not wait for all promises to resolve. -->
    <!--? It returns a promise that resolves when all the promises in the iterable have resolved. -->
    <!--? If any of the promises reject, it returns a promise that rejects with the first rejection reason. -->
    <!--? The order of the resolved values in the returned array corresponds to the order of the input promises. -->
