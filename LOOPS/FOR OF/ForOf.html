    <!--! Difference Between For Of and For In  -->
    <!--* For in Loop used to only Object. -->
    <!--* For of Loop used to Only Array.  -->
    <!--? If the for of loop applied to the object It gives an error Called Object is not Iterable.  -->
    <!--? But in case of Array the both loops are applied it does not give any error.  -->
